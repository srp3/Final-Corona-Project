What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?

How to make a simple linear text adventure game

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?

The game uses a simple story that tells the players what they should pay attention to when they go to Walmart to buy things in a special period, which is closely connected to the theme.

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
A simple and clear main line is very important for the game. Players can directly see what story the game wants to tell through the game.

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?

 A simple main story is a good thing, but the lack of more options and sidelines makes the game a bit boring. The selection branch in the game is more like a right and wrong question. If you answer wrong, the game will end directly. This is not a good idea.

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
None

Is it clear that every group member participated?
Yes

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 Yes

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

Nothing. This group wrote the main story and the division of works in the README.md, and wrote why they did it.

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.
Although the story is flawed, the game is still educational, and it tells us what to do and what not to do when buying things in the current special period.
