What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?
I forgot about the text adventure we did at the beginning of the class and revisited a lot of code for it.
 

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?
This game clearly reflects the theme of Corona. =
 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
I personally would like to do more text adventure games to practice writing.
 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
Fix spelling mistakes and don't put toliet paper as TP. I would also not include the possible choices to the player, it takes out a bit of mystery. I would also include more than two choices.
 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
No, there was nothing that was confusing.
 

Is it clear that every group member participated?
Yes, I believe it is clear that every group member participated.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes
 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
I would add more about the writing process and more of the creative side of writing the game.
 

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.
I enjoyed the little bits of humor added into the writing.
